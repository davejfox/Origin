### What is this?
This is my light, no frills starting point for front end web development. Feel free to do whatever you want with it. If 
you build something cool using it, or have any questions about it, hit me up on Twitter @davejfox.

### Woah, this is awesome - did you come up with this all yourself?
No! The grid is a stripped down version of the excellent Foundation by Zurb (http://foundation.zurb.com/) and the reset 
is a mix of Reset CSS by Eric Meyer (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/index.html), Normalize CSS by Nicholas 
Gallagher & Jonathan Neal (http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and a few other bits and pieces I've picked up along 
the way.

### Why do all the directories have underscroes in front of them?
Because Matt Hryhorsky made me do it. No seriously - it's just so that directories go to the top when you're browsing 
your files in Finder, and I like keeping all my asset related directories in a directory called "_" just to keep them 
all tucked away and tidy. If you think I'm a clean freak IRL, you'd be wrong. Dead wrong.
